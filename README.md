## Lightning Bug Game Engine

Based on the Dragonfly game engine tutorial found [here](https://dragonfly.wpi.edu/).

## SaucerShoot

Example game using the dragonfly game engine. Learing what is expected of a game engine.

## Root

The new game engine. Written in Go instead of Cpp. This is so that I spend more time refining
existing skills rather than learning how to maintain a large C project.

## Goals

- Learn about wrapping C libraries in Go (SFML graphics lib)
- If needed use generics
- Make sure all code can be run concurrently
    - Give users the ability to assign max resources?
- Practice with developing and maintaining unit tests
    - Use Table Driven Testing
    - Use Benchmarking for vital areas
- Practice with profiling tools
